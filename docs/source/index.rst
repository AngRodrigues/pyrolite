pyrolite
==========

  pyrolite is a set of tools for making the most of your geochemical data.

The python package includes functions to work with compositional data, to transform
geochemical variables (e.g. elements to oxides), functions for common plotting
tasks (e.g. spiderplots, ternary diagrams, bivariate and ternary density diagrams),
and numerous auxiliary utilities.

On this site can browse the various `submodules <./submodules.html>`__, or look through
some of the `usage examples <./usage/examples.html>`__. There's also a quick
`installation guide <./installation.html>`__ and some notes on where the project is
heading in the near `future <./future.html>`__.

If you're interested in `contributing to the project <./contributing.html>`__, there are
many potential avenues, whether you're experienced with python or not.

pyrolite comes with an extensive set of `tests <./tests.html>`__, and while these
cover most core functions and classes, they do not yet cover the entire codebase.
