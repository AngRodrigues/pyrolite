Examples
================

Plotting
---------

Pyrolite provides some functionality for basic plotting of geochemical data in the
form of spidergrams (:mod:`pyrolite.plot.spider`),
ternary diagrams (:mod:`pyrolite.plot.tern`) and
density diagrams (i.e. 2D histograms, :mod:`pyrolite.plot.density`).

alphaMELTS Utilities
----------------------

pyrolite includes a set of utilities for working with
`alphaMELTS <https://magmasource.caltech.edu/alphamelts/>`__. Note that these are
currently experimental and not affiliated with alphaMELTS. In the future, these
utilities will likely also make use of the under-development python-melts.
