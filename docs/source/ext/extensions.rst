Extensions
=============

This page will list packages which have been developed as extensions to pyrolite.

.. note:: This page is a work in progress and will updated soon as submodules from
    :mod:`pyrolite.ext` are migrated out of pyrolite to reduce installation overheads
    and unnecessary dependencies.

pyrolite-meltsutil
----------------------

  .. note:: pyrolite includes a set of utilities for working with
    `alphaMELTS <https://magmasource.caltech.edu/alphamelts/>`__. Note that these are
    currently experimental and not affiliated with alphaMELTS. In the future, these
    utilities will likely also make use of the under-development python-melts.
